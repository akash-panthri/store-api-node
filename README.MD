## Project Setup



In order to run the project, setup .env and set MONGO_URL variable equal to DB connection string and PORT variable equal to port value (port you want to run backend on) .


Routes in backend are: 

//app.get('/api/v1/products')   - get all the tasks  
//app.post('/api/v1/products/static) - get limited (specified) the task/s
